2. A conditional structure was made that allows managing the logic for even and odd colors to be handled as indicated in point 3.

3. A cycle that allows establishing the color of the boxes of the indicated model, with the use of the conditional structure requested in point 2.

4. A mixin was set to style the title *"Building a House?"*.
